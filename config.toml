The skills from these areas led me to manage all aspects of documentation for fast-growing hi-tech companies, including moving from waterfall to agile development management. As a writer and then a team lead I implemented documentation project lifecycle and the Simplified English standard to reduce the documentation project cycle by 50% and increase writer efficiency by 30%. After following the standard trends of documentation up the levels of responsibility, I now jumped into a startup that depends on Git and a static site generator to build their documentation, where I learned the process quickly and made immediate improvements for higher customer satisfaction."
